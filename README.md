Hello my nerd, my name is Ryan, also known as Totally_Not_A_Haxxer. In short, I am a bored but mentally excited human being who likes proving people wrong. I mainly spend time in cyber security specifically vehicle cyber security, reverse engineering, and of course, the most amazing- cracking people BS software which is fun.

I am mainly cyber security now, but I spend time in development where I have written a fully functional programming language called SkyLine, written in many different languages anything from C/C++ all the way up the chain to Go and down the chain to Fortran.

# Other Info 

I do not bite. Do not be scared. I mostly hang out in the Martian Defense community, so you can catch me there when you solve the CTF [here](https://www.martiandefense.llc/ctf-challenges-writeups)

I also love adrenaline, it's the one thing that keeps me moving so I itch for something new and I thrive to find something that brings me past my limits.
